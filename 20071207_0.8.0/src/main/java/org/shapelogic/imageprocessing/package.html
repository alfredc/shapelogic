<h2>Vectorizers</h2>

<p>A vectorizer is an algorithm for transforming bitmap lines into vector lines.</p>
<p>
There are 3 different implementations vectorizers in ShapeLogic. <br/>
There are currently 3 different vectorizer implementations. 
They all assume that you are working on binary gray scale images images. 
So before you can use a vectorizer you have to convert your bitmap to this format.<br/>
The 2 first had a lot of problems and are now deprecated.<br/>
The vectorizers are part of a class hierarchy of different vectorization 
algorithms, all sub classed from BaseVectorizer.
</p>

<h3>Common to current vectorizer implementations</h3>

<ul>
<li>Assumes that you have a gray scale image with only black and white in it</li> 
<li>Are modifying the bitmap</li> 
</ul>

It would probably be a good idea to loosen some of these restrictions. 

<h3>MaxDistanceVectorizer</h3>
The main idea is that this will read a whole multi line at a time. 
Then later it will split it according to max distance of pixels to the line 
between start and end point of the multi line.<br/>
This vectorizer is the one that works well.

<h3>LineVectorizer</h3>
LineVectorizer is a vectorizer reading sequences of short line of length 5. 
If 2 consecutive lines are close in direction you can merge them. 
But if they are far away in angle you create a new line.<br/>
This approach ran into problems and has been deprecated for now.

<h3>DirectionBasedVectorizer</h3>
The main idea is that this will read a whole multi line at a time. 
It is using a priority of different types of points around an intersection to 
read trough an intersection where you can take different ways.<br/>
This approach ran into problems and has been deprecated for now.

<h2>Segmentation</h2>

<p>Color and gray scale segmentation algorithm. 
The segmentation algorithm works on both RGB and 8 bit gray scale images.
</p>
<p>
It is currently writing out information to a dialog box.
