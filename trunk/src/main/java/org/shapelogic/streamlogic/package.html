<h2>streamlogic</h2>

New library for functional programming style lazy calculation.<br />
<br />
This is going to replace the system up to ShapeLogic 0.8 what was mainly based 
on goal driven tasks. Somewhat like the language Prolog but without 
backtracking or unification. <br />
The same rules that before was creating tasks are now creating derivative streams. 

<h2>Dependency</h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li>This package can depend on util, calculation.</li> 
<li>There is no dependency of any image processing code or any external libraries outside Java 6.</li> 
<li>This can be used in a Java application, just by adding shapelogic_.jar.</li> 
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Declarative programming</h2>
<p>
Declarative programming in ShapeLogic is build on the following: 
<br />
<ul>
<li>Rule database that can access Java object using Scripting languages or JEXL</li> 
<li>Streams / lazy lists</li> 
<li>Lazy calculations</li> 
<li>Inversion of Control, IoC, for creating the right object implementing an interface</li> 
</ul>
