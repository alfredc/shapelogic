Particle Counter and Analyzer

  Starting in 1.2 ShapeLogic contains both an automatic color and gray scale particle
  counter and a particle analyzer working without manual user intervention.
  The goal is to be able to recognize different cells on a relatively uniform 
  background and be able to extract a lot of geometric information.
  
  See {{{cell.html}Cell Categorizer}} for images types that can be handled by
  the current particle analyzer, and for future plans.
  
  ShapeLogic 1.3 introduced 2 new modes for the particle analyzer: one where 
  you set the foreground color of the particles and one where you set the
  background color. They will always find a particle image and will not fail,
  unlike the automatic particle analyzer.
  
  ShapeLogic 1.5 introduced neural network machine learning.
  
* Common functionality for particle counter and particle analyzer 
  
  * Take input parameters, e.g. min and max size for particles 
  
  * Find background color
  
  * Find particles
  
  * Extract geometric properties of the particles
  
  * Print a report to a result table that can be exported to Excel
  
  []
  
* Usage
  
  {Test} on example particle image embryos.jpg
    
[images/particles/embryos.jpg] 

  Under ImageJ Plugins ShapeLogic menu click 
  "Particle Counter", "Color Particle Analyzer" or "RGB Color Particle Analyzer".
  
[images/particles/shapelogicmenu.png] 
  
** Input parameters dialog
  
  Select input parameters in dialog
  
[images/particles/particleInputDialog.png] 
  
  The parameters 
  
  Max distance: Distance between color in same color bucket
  
  Min pixels: Minimum number of pixels in particle
  
  Max pixels: Maximum number of pixels in particle
  
  Iterations: {{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_algorithm}K-mean}} iterations for color hypothesis
  
  CountOnly: Only count particles, do not trace edge, vectorize, annotate and match
  
  ToMask: Turns the image into a black and white mask, with black particles
  
  DisplayInternalInfo: Print out polygon, points and their annotations
  
  UseNeuralNetwork: Use neural network for classification
  
  These are the default values and the name of the parameters in Java.
  
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
_iterations = 2; // K-mean iterations for color hypothesis
_maxDistance = 50; // Distance between color in same color bucket
_minPixelsInArea = 5; // Minimum number of pixels in particle
_maxPixelsInArea = 10000; // Maximum number of pixels in particle
+-------------------------------------------------------------+

** Output image if {mask} option is set

[images/particles/embryos6mask.jpg] 
  
  Check ToMask check box in order to better see what particles were found and to 
  post process it with other tools. 
  The built in particle analyzer in ImageJ contains functionality that is not
  available here e.g. 
  
  * Ellipse fitter

  * Outline and add numbers
  
  []
  
  Here is the result of running outline and add numbers 
  
[images/particles/embryos6numbered_outline.png]

  The numbering scheme used in ImageJ particle analyzer is the same as the one
  used in ShapeLogic. Start from top left corner.

** Summary result dialog

  A summary result is shown in a dialog, with the following information:
  
[images/particles/particleCountDialog.png] 

  A report of each particle's properties is sent to an ImageJ result table, 
  which can be exported to Excel.
  Reports are different for the particle counter and analyzer. 
  
* Particle counter information for each particle 
  
  The particle counter finds and prints basic geometric properties of the particles
  
[images/particles/particleCounterResult.png]

  * Area 
  
  * Center of gravity 
  
  * Color
  
  * Std dev for color
  
  []
  
* Particle analyzer information for each particle

  The particle analyzer traces the edge of each particle. It finds and prints 
  more advanced geometric properties of the particles
  
[images/particles/particleAnalyzerResult.png]
  
  * Area 
  
  * Center of gravity 
  
  * Color
  
  * Std dev for color
  
  * Length of perimeter
  
  * Circularity
  
  * Gray value brightness
  
  * Bounding box
  
  * Number of hard corners
  
  * Number of inflection points
  
  * Number of curve arches
  
  []
  
  For color images it will also write out average R, G and B channels.
  
  The particle analyzer finds many more geometric properties that are not shown
  on the above example, it is easy to print them if desired.
  
  This the particle analyzer can also select and categorize particles based 
  on all of the above properties.
  In order to categorize particles the user should define geometric rules for
  each particle type.

  ShapeLogic v 1.6 will come with predefined rules to {{{cell.html}categorize certain cells}}.
  
  If you want more detailed information mark check box DisplayInternalInfo.

* Particle analyzer in manual {rgb} modes
  
  ShapeLogic 1.3 introduces 2 new color modes for the particle analyzer.
  
  You find them under the menu item: RGB Color Particle Analyzer.
  
  One will set the background color the other sets the foreground color.
  
[images/particles/rgb_particleInputDialog.png]
  
** Set foreground color mode
  
  This is useful for
  
  * Particles with different colors, where you are only interested in one 
  
  * Particles in {{{colocalization.html}co-localization}} images 
  
  * Images that are not particle images
  
  []
   
  Here is an example
  
[images/particles/legionella_pneumophila10157.jpg]
  
  {{{http://phil.cdc.gov/phil}CDC image}} 10157 legionella pneumophila
  
  The setting in the dialog was to find the purple bacteria.
  
** Set background color mode
  
  This is useful for
  
  * Close up of a particle where the background color is not the most frequent 
  
  * You are working on a small ROI region of interest
  
  []
  
* Current status of the particle analyzer in ShapeLogic v 1.5 
  
  The particle analyzer in ShapeLogic v 1.5 has gone through limited testing 
  and seems to work well. 
  
* Framework to build more advanced particle counters and particle analyzers
  
  The particle counter algorithm in ShapeLogic 1.5 is relatively simple. It is 
  setup to be expanded to handle more advanced algorithms. Here is the flow.
  
  * If either foreground or background color is set you are done
  
  * Else find one or more color hypothesis automatically
  
    * Color clustering using K-mean algorithm
  
    * Background color finder
  
    * Check that image is a particle image, if it is not stop
    
    []
  
  * Run over the image again find the individual particles based on the color 
  hypothesis
  
  * Collect color and area information for each particle
  
  * Filter particles based on size
  
  []

* Defining rules for categories in ShapeLogic 1.5
  
  This is done by sub classing ColorParticleAnalyzer or ColorParticleAnalyzerIJ.
  Override the categorizeStreams() method.
  
  Use ColorParticleAnalyzerIJ if you work with ImageJ and ColorParticleAnalyzer 
  if you work without.

  Here is the current categorize code. It is only there to serve as an example: 
  
  The {{{logic-language.html#syntax} rule syntax}} is very straightforward. 
  There are a lot of numeric streams
  with one lazy calculated number for each particle. E.g. aspect ratio stream.
  Then you define one rule for each constraint you want to put on a given
  category.
  
  In order to belong to the category Flat the aspect ratio for a particle just 
  has to greater than 1.1.
  
  In order to belong to the category "Light round" the aspect ratio for a particle just 
  has to between 0.9 and 1.1 and the brightness have to be greater than 150.
  
  Note that a particle that satisfy more categories will not belong to any of them.
  
  ** Default rules and neural network for categories in ShapeLogic 1.5
  
+-----------------------------------+
	@Override
	protected void categorizeStreams() {
		loadParticleStreams.exampleMakeParticleStream();
        if (_useNeuralNetwork) {
                defineNeuralNetwork();
        }
        else {
            loadLetterStreams.makeXOrStream(StreamNames.PARTICLES, LoadParticleStreams.EXAMPLE_PARTICLE_ARRAY);
            _categorizer = (ListStream<String>) QueryCalc.getInstance().get(StreamNames.PARTICLES, this);
        }
	}

	private void defineNeuralNetwork() {
		String[] objectHypotheses = new String[] {"Tall", "Flat"};
		String[] inputStreamName = {StreamNames.ASPECT};
		double[][] weights = ExampleNeuralNetwork.makeSmallerThanGreaterThanNeuralNetwork(1.); 
		_neuralNetworkStream = new FFNeuralNetworkStream(
				inputStreamName,objectHypotheses, weights,this);
         _categorizer = _neuralNetworkStream.getOutputStream();
	}
	
	
	final static public String[] EXAMPLE_PARTICLE_ARRAY = 
	{"Flat","Tall","Light round", "Dark round"};	
	
	/** This shows what to do to define rules for the color particle analyzer.<br />
	 * 
	 * This is not useful.<br /> 
	 * Light and dark is turned around if inverted LUT is used.<br /> 
	 */
	public static void exampleMakeParticleStream() {
		LoadLetterStreams.rule("Flat", ASPECT_RATIO, ">", 1.1, null);
		
		LoadLetterStreams.rule("Tall", ASPECT_RATIO, "<", 0.9, null);

		LoadLetterStreams.rule("Light round", StreamNames.COLOR_GRAY, ">", 150, null);
		LoadLetterStreams.rule("Light round", ASPECT_RATIO, "<", 1.1, null);
		LoadLetterStreams.rule("Light round", ASPECT_RATIO, ">", 0.9, null);

		LoadLetterStreams.rule("Dark round", StreamNames.COLOR_GRAY, "<", 120, null);
		LoadLetterStreams.rule("Dark round", ASPECT_RATIO, "<", 1.1, null);
		LoadLetterStreams.rule("Dark round", ASPECT_RATIO, ">", 0.9, null);
	}
+-----------------------------------+

  Currently you have to override categorizeStreams() to customize neural 
  network or rule set, this will be re factored so there are 2 protected 
  methods that can be overridden: 
  
  * defineNeuralNetwork()
   
  * defineRules()
  
  []
  
* How to {override} Color Particle Analyzer category rules
  
  Here is a very simple example that overrides both the declarative rule set 
  and the neural network:
    
** Overriding rule set example

  This example only has 2 categories Flat and Non flat. 
  It is flat if it twice as wide as it is high.
  
** Overriding neural network example
  
  This example only has 2 categories Light and Dark.

  Copy the following text into a file called CustomParticleAnalyzer_.java:

import org.shapelogic.imageprocessing.ColorParticleAnalyzerIJ;
import org.shapelogic.logic.CommonLogicExpressions;
import org.shapelogic.machinelearning.ExampleNeuralNetwork;
import org.shapelogic.machinelearning.FFNeuralNetworkStream;
import org.shapelogic.streamlogic.LoadLetterStreams;
import org.shapelogic.streamlogic.StreamNames;
import org.shapelogic.streams.XOrListStream;

public class CustomParticleAnalyzer_ extends ColorParticleAnalyzerIJ {
	
    @Override
    protected void categorizeStreams() {
        loadParticleStreams.exampleMakeParticleStream();
        if (_useNeuralNetwork) {  
            //----------Override neural network----------
            String[] objectHypotheses = new String[] {"Dark", "Light"};
            String[] inputStreamName = {StreamNames.COLOR_GRAY};
            double[][] weights = ExampleNeuralNetwork.makeSmallerThanGreaterThanNeuralNetwork(128.); 
            _neuralNetworkStream = new FFNeuralNetworkStream(
                inputStreamName,objectHypotheses, weights,this);
             _categorizer = _neuralNetworkStream.getOutputStream();
        }
        else { //
            //----------Override declarative rule set----------
            LoadLetterStreams loadLetterStreams = new LoadLetterStreams(this);
            loadLetterStreams.rule("Flat", CommonLogicExpressions.ASPECT_RATIO, ">", 2, null);
            loadLetterStreams.rule("Non flat", CommonLogicExpressions.ASPECT_RATIO, "<", 2, null);
            loadLetterStreams.makeXOrStream(StreamNames.PARTICLES, new String[] {"Flat", "Non flat"});
            _categorizer = (XOrListStream) getContext().get(StreamNames.PARTICLES);
        }
    }
}
+-----------------------------------+
  
** Compile from within ImageJ

  * Place the CustomParticleAnalyzer_.java into ImageJ/plugin/ShapeLogic directory.
  
  * Compile it from within ImageJ, by going to Plugin -> Compile and Run ...

  []
  
** Compile from outside ImageJ

  * Compile CustomParticleAnalyzer_.java someplace else using Eclipse,
  NetBeans or javac and take the resulting class file:

  CustomParticleAnalyzer_.class 
  
  * Move it into ImageJ/plugin/ShapeLogic directory.

  []

* Loading neural network from text file in ShapeLogic 1.6
  
  Starting in ShapeLogic 1.6 you can load the neural network from external text
  files.  
  
  ShapeLogic has an example file:
  shapelogic/src/test/resources/data/neuralnetwork/default_particle_nn.txt
  with this content:
  
+-----------------------------------+
========== FEATURES
aspect
========== RESULTS
tall
flat
========== WEIGHTS
1. -1. 
-1. 1.
+-----------------------------------+
  
  It will produce the same effect as the default color particle analyzer 
  neural network. Except for the categories not being capitalized.
  
* Plans for ShapeLogic 1.6
  
  * Make custom rules to recognize specific {{{cell.html}cells}}. 
  In v 1.5 the user has to make rules themselves.
  
  * Make it easier to select what particle properties to print out, now a 
  random selection of somewhat useful properties have been selected.
  
  * HSV mode for the particle analyzer
  
  * Possibly {{{http://ei.cs.vt.edu/~history/Perceptrons.Estebon.html}Perceptron styled}}
  1 layered neural network for rules for particle analyzer
  
  []
  
* Possible future plans for particle analyzer beyond ShapeLogic v 1.5
  
  * ShapeLogic 1.6 may come with predefined rules for certain cells
  
  * Create rule for recognizing cells using neural networks or machine learning techniques

  * Be able to handle a background that is not uniform, and cell organelles

  * Incorporate reasoning under uncertainty using the lazy stream library
  
  * Extend to do tracking of particles in a video sequence
  
  * Find overlapping particles and distinguish them as separate 
  
  []
  
** Create rule for recognizing cells using neural networks or machine learning techniques
  
  In order to do this the user will have to select the properties that should 
  be used to train the network or use the machine learning on.
  
  It is probably easiest to export all the properties to a spreadsheet, add a 
  result field, and run an external neural network or machine learning program.
  The result will then be put back into a ShapeLogic stream.
  
  Right now the classifier stream is an Exclusive Or stream. 
  There need to be streams that 
  
  * Do weighted 1 and 2 layer computations.
  
  * Do binary decisions based on properties.
