Machine learning

  Started in 1.5 ShapeLogic combines the declarative
  programming framework with machine learning techniques.
  First machine learning technique is a multi layer feed forward neural network
  that is trained externally but run internally.


* Neural network in ShapeLogic 1.5

  ShapeLogic 1.5 implement a multi layer feed forward neural network.

  The default network is very simple it is marking particles Tall, Flat based 
  on their aspect ratio. This is the code for it in 
  {{{http://code.google.com/p/shapelogic/source/browse/trunk/src/main/java/org/shapelogic/imageprocessing/ColorParticleAnalyzer.java}ColorParticleAnalyzer.java}}.

+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
private void defineNeuralNetwork() {
	String[] objectHypotheses = new String[] {"Tall", "Flat"};
	String[] inputStreamName = {StreamNames.ASPECT};
	double[][] weights = ExampleNeuralNetwork.makeSmallerThanGreaterThanNeuralNetwork(1.); 
	_neuralNetworkStream = new FFNeuralNetworkStream(
			inputStreamName,objectHypotheses, weights,this);
     _categorizer = _neuralNetworkStream.getOutputStream();
}
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
  
  
  The method makeSmallerThanGreaterThanNeuralNetwork(double limit) is
  very simple and returns :
  
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
new double[][] {
    {
        1, -1, //Bias first hidden layer
        -1., 1
    },
};
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
  
  I you want to use your own neural network in ShapeLogic 1.5. You have to 
  subclass ColorParticleAnalyzer and override: defineNeuralNetwork().
  
  In ShapeLogic 1.6 will be able to load this in a more convenient way either
  from a flat file with a simple syntax or from a database and the neural 
  network will be extended to work with letter matcher.
  
* Machine learning techniques

  Machine learning is by now a well established field that has been around for
  decades. Here are a few techniques:

  * Multi layer feed forward neural network (error back propagation)

  * Perceptron network (simple 1 layered feed forward neural network)

  * Learning Decision Trees

  []


* Open source implementations of neural networks with language and license

  * {{{http://www.jooneworld.com/}Joone}} Java, LGPL

  * {{{http://www.simbrain.net/}simbrain}} Java, GPL

  * {{{http://www.geocities.com/adotsaha/NNinExcel.html}NNinExcel}} Excel, ?

  []

  {{{http://www.jooneworld.com/}Joone}}
  is a very user friendly system that takes input and produces output in
  several different formats: Database, Excel and flat file

* Process for training network

  * Select list of input features

  * Run one or more images and save result table as a spreadsheet

  * If more than one concatenate the spreadsheets to one spreadsheet

  * Make a list of matches

  * Train a multi layer neural network externally using e.g. Joone

  * If successful network can be found use it otherwise chose new list of input features

  * Save weights to flat file or database

  []

  When running the network load the weights from flat file or database.

* Export the weights from Joone

  Joone seperate the weights from the the bias. While ShapeLogic
  used the bias as the first weights.

  You can export the weights from Joone, by going in an inspecting both the
  synapses and the layers. Do a copy and pase them to a spreadsheet or a text
  file.

  The copy does not work under all versions of Linux, but it works fine under
  Windows.

* Integrating neural networks into declarative programming framework

  The implementation a feed forward neural networks into declarative programming
  framework under ShapeLogic is called:
  {{{http://code.google.com/p/shapelogic/source/browse/trunk/src/main/java/org/shapelogic/machinelearning/FFNeuralNetworkStream.java}FFNeuralNetworkStream}}

  It consists of 3 linked streams, the 2 last streams are created by attaching a
  Calc1 to the stream before it:

  * {{{http://code.google.com/p/shapelogic/source/browse/trunk/src/main/java/org/shapelogic/streams/ArrayOutputListStream.java}ArrayOutputListStream}}
  takes a list of names of features a produces a ListStream of double array

  * {{{http://code.google.com/p/shapelogic/source/browse/trunk/src/main/java/org/shapelogic/machinelearning/FFNeuralNetwork.java}FFNeuralNetwork}}
  is a Calc1 from double array to double array representing a fully connected
  feed forward neural network

  * {{{http://code.google.com/p/shapelogic/source/browse/trunk/src/main/java/org/shapelogic/machinelearning/ConfidenceArraySelector.java}ConfidenceArraySelector}}
  is a Calc1 this turns the double array into a String result

  []

  Dependent streams should be defined in the database or flat file
