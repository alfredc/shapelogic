Stream Dictionary work in progress

  If the user wanted to customizing rule set or neural networks for either the 
  {{{particle.html}Color Particle Analyzer}} or for the 
  {{{letter-match.html}letter matcher}} it demands 
  making a {{{categorizer-setup.html}categorizer setup file}} or
  {{{programming.html}programming}}.
  
  In order to do this you need to understand what is in the different lazy data streams.
  This page is a dictionary of them.
  
* Stream Dictionary in polygons
  
  
  * <<aspectRatio>> Aspect ratio of polygon, higher is wider, smaller is taller, 1 is even 
  
  * <<curveArchCount>> A line can either be straight or be a curve arch 
  
  * <<endPointCount>> Number of end points in a polygon 
  
  * <<endpointBottomPointCount>> Number of end point is the bottom (half?) 
  
  * <<endpointBottomRightThirdPointCount>> Number of end point is the bottom right third
  
  * <<endpointTopLeftThirdPointCount>> Number of end points in top left third 
  
  * <<hardPointCount>> A point can either hard corner or a soft point this is the count of hard corners 
  
  * <<holeCount>> Number of holes enclosed by a polygon
  
  * <<horizontalLineCount>> Number of roughly horizontal lines in a polygon 
  
  * <<lineCount>> Number of line segments in a polygon
  
  * <<multiLineCount>> A multi line is made up of 2 or more points, but with no Y junctions 
  
  * <<pointCount>> Number of points in a polygon
  
  * <<tJunctionCount>> Number of T junction in a polygon
  
  * <<tJunctionLeftCount>> T junction in the left half of the bounding box
  
  * <<tJunctionRightCount>> T junction in the right half of the bounding box
  
  * <<uJunctionCount>> Number of undecided junctions that can be T junction or Y junction 
  
  * <<verticalLineCount>> Number of roughly vertical lines in a polygon
