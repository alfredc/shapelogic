<h2>Machine Learning</h2>

This package currently contains a simple feed forward neural network
integrated into the lazy stream framework.<br />
<br />
The training of the neural network is done externally, but run internally.<br />

Steps in supervised learning for the color particle analyzer.<br />

To train the neural network you need a list of images each with one or more
particles, here are some of the things you need to do:<br />

<ul>
<li>You have to assign different categories to the different particles</li>
<li>You need to select which geometric property data streams you want as input</li>
<li>This should be a minimal list otherwise you can get over fitting problems</li>
<li>Possibly create new geometric property data streams</li>
<li>Find out how many neural network layers you need</li>
<li>Find out how many nodes in each layer you need</li>
<li>Store this information so it can be reused</li>
</ul>

<p>
The reason for not doing training inside ShapeLogic is:
ImageJ has the simple and powerful PlugInFilter concept and it would be very
hard to get all that functionality into a PlugInFilter without creating
something that is quite complex.
</p>

<p>
Joone - Java Object Oriented Neural Engine
http://www.jooneworld.com/ is a great tool to train the neural network used in
ShapeLogic.

<h2>Dependency</h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li>This package can depend on util, calculation, streams.</li> 
<li>There is no dependency of any image processing code or any external libraries outside Java 6.</li> 
<li>This can be used in a Java application, just by adding shapelogic_.jar.</li> 
</ul>
