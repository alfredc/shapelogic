<h2>Scripting</h2>

Utility classes so ShapeLogic works with the new Java 6 Scripting framwork.<br />
<br />


<h2>Dependency on ShapeLogic</h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li>This package can only depend on util.</li> 
<li>There is no dependency of any image processing code or any external libraries outside Java 6.</li> 
<li>This can be used in a Java application, just by adding shapelogic_.jar.</li> 
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Dependency on Sun jars</h2>
<p>
The only scripting language that works out of the box with Java 6 is JavaScript. To get others to work you have to download jsr223-engines.zip from:
https://scripting.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectDocumentList
For each language you want to use there is a engine jar file.
E.g. jruby-engine.jar.
They have to be on your path. So does the jar file implementing the language.
