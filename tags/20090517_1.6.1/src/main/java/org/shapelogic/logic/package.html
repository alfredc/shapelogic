<h2>Goal driven logic</h2>

This are tasks with subtasks, they can create an AI choice tree if there are 
choices that cannot be made.<br />
There are simple rules at the lowest level e.g.<br />
polygon.holeCount = 1<br />
<br />
At higher level these are grouped into clusters with AndTasks.<br />
To make choices use an XORTask.<br />
It is currently not super well integrated with the stream package that was 
introduced in ShapeLogic 0.9.<br />
This should be addressed in ShapeLogic 1.0.

<h2>Dependency</h2>
<p>
There is no dependency of any image processing code
<ul>
<li>This package can depend on util, calculation, scripting.</li> 
<li>There is no dependency of any image processing</li> 
<li>Depends on JEXL, Antlr and other external libraries</li> 
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Declarative programming</h2>
<p>
Declarative programming in ShapeLogic is build on the following: 
<br />
<ul>
<li>Rule database that can access Java object using Scripting languages or JEXL</li> 
<li>Streams / lazy lists</li> 
<li>Lazy calculations</li> 
<li>Goal driven tasks</li> 
<li>Maybe later IoC</li> 
</ul>
