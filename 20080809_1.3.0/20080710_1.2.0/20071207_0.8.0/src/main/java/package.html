<h2>Vectorizers</h2>

<p>A vectorizer is an algorithm for transforming bitmap lines into vector lines.</p>
<p>
There are 3 different implementations vectorizers in ShapeLogic. <br/>
They are all just thin wrappers around classes located in the impageprocessing package.
</p>

<h2>Segmentation</h2>

<p>Color and gray scale segmentation algorithm. 
The segmentation algorithm works on both RGB and 8 bit gray scale images.
</p>
<p>
It is currently writing out information to a dialog box.
</p>

<h2>Letter matching</h2>
<p>This is not done in Java, but is just 2 macro files that is places in the shapelogic dir.
