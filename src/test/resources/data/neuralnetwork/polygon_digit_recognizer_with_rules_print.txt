0 and 1.

========== def 0
holeCount == 1
tJunctionCount == 0
endPointCount == 0
multiLineCount == 1
curveArchCount > 0
hardPointCount == 0
softPointCount > 0

========== def 1
holeCount == 0
tJunctionLeftCount == 0
tJunctionRightCount == 0
endpointBottomPointCount == 1
horizontalLineCount == 0
verticalLineCount == 1
endPointCount == 2
multiLineCount == 0
softPointCount == 0
