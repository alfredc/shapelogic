/** Universal calculation and logic unit.
 * 
 * If this is an expansion of the calculation do I need a dirty?
 * 
 * If there is only one value then a dirty makes sense. 
 * So maybe I should just override this for single element.
 * 
 * Should I assume that null means absent of value?
 * That seems a little harsh. 
 * 
 * I think that I can have a special index for single values.
 * So if that is different from null a calculation have been made.
 * 
 * I could also have a isEmpty method.
 * 
 * What about a setup or a init method?
 * 
 * Maybe it should be a isDone method instead. 
 * Or dirty can just mean the opposite of done.
 * 
 * Let me try to sub interface this and see if I can make a single calculation 
 * and a stream out of this.
 * 
 * I think that maybe I should only extend the iterator and not the list. 
 * Then override just the get method. Then there should be less trouble with 
 * signatures.
 * 
 * I might also extend or override the map.
 * So I would have both a get(int i) and a get(Object obj)
 * 
 * Could I delegate the list specific work based on what is known?
 * 
 * Maybe I would think that as far as a calculation model everything should 
 * work the same.
 * 
 * One problem might be a self reference.
