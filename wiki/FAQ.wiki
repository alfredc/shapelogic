== Why won't ShapeLogic run as a plugin for ImageJ? ==
The problem is that there are several jar files that are needed for it to run.
This is described on the [GettingStarted] page

== Does ShapeLogic work with other plugins for ImageJ? ==
  * ShapeLogic should work with other plugins.
  * ShapeLogic uses off the shelf open source libraries when possible.
  * ShapeLogic is a very lightweight framework.

== Does ShapeLogic work without ImageJ? ==
Not now. But ShapeLogic is very loosely coupled to ImageJ, so abstracting the connection to ImageJ out should not be a big task.
