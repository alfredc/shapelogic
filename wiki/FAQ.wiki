== ShapeLogic will not run as a plugin for ImageJ ==
The problem is that there are several jar files that are needed for it to run.
This is described on the [GettingStarted] page

== Does ShapeLogic work with other plugins for ImageJ ==
  * The intention with SahpeLogic is that is should work with other plugins.
  * ShapeLogic is using of the shelve best of breed open source libraries when possible.
  * ShapeLogic is trying to be a very lightweight framework.

== Does ShapeLogic work without ImageJ ==
Not now. But ShapeLogic is very loosely coupled to ImageJ. 
So abstracting the connection to ImageJ out should not be too big a task.
