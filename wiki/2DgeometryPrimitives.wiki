#Classes for 2D geometry primitives.

= 2D geometry primitives =

The goal for these new classes for 2D geometry primitives is:
  * Simple classes for doing affine 2D geometry that works as closely with standard libraries as possible
  * Builds on top of Java AWT Point classes

For anything more complicated use these comprehensive existing mathematics libraries:
