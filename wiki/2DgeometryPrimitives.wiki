#Classes for 2D geometry primitives.

= 2D geometry primitives =

The goal for these new classes for 2D geometry primitives is:
  * Simple classes for doing affine 2D geometry that is works as closely with standard libraries as possible.
  * Build on top of Java AWT Point classes.

For anything more complicated use the good mathematic libraries:
  * [http://commons.apache.org/math/ commons-math]
  * [http://dsd.lbl.gov/~hoschek/colt/ colt]

These math libraries were too heavyweight to work with simple affine plane geometry.
