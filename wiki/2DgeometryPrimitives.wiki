#Classes for 2D geometry primitives.

= 2D geometry primitives =

When starting my work I was trying to find a good library for this 2D geometry primitives.
I did not find anything that fit my needs too well.
There are good math libraries, [http://dsd.lbl.gov/~hoschek/colt/ colt] and [http://commons.apache.org/math/ commons-math], but they are too heavyweight to work with simple affine plane geometry.

Java has some very elementary points in awt.

So I decided to build on top of Java awt.
