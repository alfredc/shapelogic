#Classes for 2D geometry primitives.

= http://shapelogic.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/shapelogicsmalltransparent.png 2D geometry primitives =

The goal for these new classes for 2D geometry primitives is:
  * Simple classes for doing affine 2D geometry that works as closely with standard libraries as possible
  * Builds on top of Java AWT Point classes

For anything more complicated use these comprehensive existing mathematics libraries:
  * [http://commons.apache.org/math/ commons-math]
  * [http://dsd.lbl.gov/~hoschek/colt/ colt]

= 2D geometry primitives main classes =
  * CPointInt
  * CPointDouble
  * CLine
  * MultiLine
  * Polygon
  * MultiLinePolygon

= 2D geometry primitives main interfaces =
  * IPoint2D

= Annotations =
There are annotations for both points and lines.

Annotations for points live in 2 enumerations:
  * PixelType used when working on pixels in a bitmap
  * PointType used when working on points as coordinates

Annotations for lines live in this enumeration:
LineType
