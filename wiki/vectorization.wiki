#Standard vectorization algorithm.

= Vectorization algorithms =

Simple algorithm for transforming bitmap lines into vector lines.

= Different implementations =

There are currently 3 different implementations
They all assume that you are working on binary gray scale images images.
So before you can use these you have to convert your bitmap to this.

The live in a class hierarchy of different vectorization algorithms, all sub classed from BaseVectorizer.

== MaxDistanceVectorizer ==
The main idea is that this will read a whole multi line at a time.
Then later it will split it according to max distance of pixels to the line between start and end point of the multi line.

== LineVectorizer ==
LineVectorizer is a vectorizer using short line of default length 5
You do a sequence of small lines, if 2 consecutive lines are close in direction you can merge them.
But if they are far away in angle you create a new line.
Also you can only have 2 direction within the same line, they are stored by cycle index.

This approach ran into problems and has been deprecated for now.

== DirectionBasedVectorizer ==
The main idea is that this will read a whole multi line at a time.
It is using a priority of different types of points around an intersection to read trough an intersection where you can take different ways.

This approach ran into problems and has been deprecated for now.
