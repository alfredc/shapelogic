#Getting started

= Getting started =

You can use ShapeLogic in different ways:
  * Development mode
  * User mode


= Development mode =

You need to have [http://maven.apache.org/ Maven 2] installed.

Currently the project is set up to work directly with Eclipse 3.3, but you can use:
NetBeans, IntelliJ, emacs, vi or notepad.

Check out the code into a local directory.

Run:
  * *mvn test* runs the unit tests locally
  * *mvn package* runs the unit tests locally, and if they passes it will create the jar file

= User mode =

You currently need a version of ShapeLogic that has the operations you need compiled in.
Here are the steps to get it to work with ImageJ:
  * Create a ShapeLogic dir under ImageJ: ./ImageJ/plugins/ShapeLogic
  * Take the jar file for ShapeLogic and move it to that directory: shapelogic_-0.2.jar

When you open ImageJ there will be a ShapeLogic dir with commands in.
