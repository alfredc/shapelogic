#Getting started

= Getting started =

You can use ShapeLogic in different ways:
  * Development mode
  * User mode

= User mode =

== Steps to get ShapeLogic working from within ImageJ ==
  * Create a ShapeLogic dir under ImageJ: ./ImageJ/plugins/ShapeLogic
  * Take the jar file for ShapeLogic: shapelogic_-0.2.jar, and move it to that directory

When you open ImageJ there will be a ShapeLogic dir with commands in.

There not yet binary distribution. When you compile ShapeLogic yourself it will be placed here:
./shapelogic/target/shapelogic_-0.2.jar

== Java and logic ==
If you need to add you own rules to ShapeLogic you need to compile your own version.

The goal is to move to have a database with the logical rules you need separate from the jar file, so you do not have to recompile.


= Development mode =

ShapeLogic is build using [http://maven.apache.org/ Maven 2].

This makes several build tasks very easy, so this is the recommended way doing builds, but the code should run fine without Maven.

Currently the project is set up to work directly with Eclipse 3.3, Java 1.6, but you can use: NetBeans, IntelliJ, emacs or vi.

== Steps to compile and run unit tests ==

Check ShapeLogic out into a local directory.

Do a cd into that directory.

Run:
  * *mvn test* runs the unit tests locally
  * *mvn package* runs the unit tests locally, and if they passes it will create the jar file


== Changing JDK version ==

You will have to change the JDK target in pom.xml:
{{{
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
        <configuration>
          <source>1.6</source>
          <target>1.6</target>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
}}}
